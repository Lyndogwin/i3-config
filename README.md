# i3-config
Note: Folders ```i3``` and ```i3status``` go into the ```.config``` directory in home or ```~/```. The remaining files go directly into ```~/```

Alternatively, you can create symbolic links for the files in this directory. Just create aforementioned links where you would put the original files.

### Additional Dependencies (Primarily for personal recall/ should apply to those also using ubuntu)
* ```fcitx``` with mozc for Japanese Kana input
* ```light``` for brightness controls
