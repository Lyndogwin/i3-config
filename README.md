# i3-config
Note: Folders ```i3``` and ```i3status``` go into the ```.config``` directory found in the home or ```~/``` directory. The remaining files go directly into ```~/```

Alternatively, you can create symbolic links for the files in this directory. Either run ```config-i3.sh``` or Just create aforementioned links where you would put the original files.
